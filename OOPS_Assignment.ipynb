        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- It organizes code into objects, which combine data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- It is blue print/templete for creating an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- It is an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity. It contains data, attributes and function's methods that define its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction: it is a concept of hiding complex implementation.\n",
        "- Encapsulatin: it is bundling the data and method of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- They are the method defined in built-in classes in python. It is used to create custom object and implementing operator overloading in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "- Inheritance reffers of child recieving the properties of parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- It reffers to an object taking several form depanding on the methods/data.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation can be achieved in Python by using the access modifier like public, private and proected classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor in Python is a special method named __init__() that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class methods(@classmethod):It is bound to the class and not to a perticular instence of a class. It can be access/modify method and attributrs associated to the class across all the instances.\n",
        "- Static methods(@staticmethod):It can not be access/modify the class or instence state, it behave like a plain function.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- The last method overloads the privious ones in the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method in parent class and child class with same signature, the child class will be exxecuted.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- Property decorator is allows mrthod to be used as attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- It allows different classes to be used interchangeably through a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is used to define a common interface for its subclasses. It can contain abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "-  The advantages of OOP is Reusablity, flexibility and Data Security.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variable: Defined inside the class, but outside any method.\n",
        "- Instance variable: Defined inside the constructor (__init__) using self.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- When one child class may inherit multiple parent class it called multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘__str__’ and ‘__repr__’  methods in Python?\n",
        "- ‘__str__’ -  Returns a user-friendly or readable string representation of the object.\n",
        "- ‘__repr__’ - Returns a developer-oriented string that ideally can recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (super) class inside a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__() method in Python is a decorators that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @staticmethod:- No need of arguments and can not access or modify.\n",
        "- @classmethod:- cls as the first argument and it can be access or modify the class level attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called in a single line, one after another, on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__() method in Python allows an object to be called like a function."
